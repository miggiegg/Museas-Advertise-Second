		<div>Let’s face it – most users hate ads, and rightfully so. Advertisements are becoming more pervasive, obnoxious, and intrusive. On computers and smartphones, adblockers are increasingly being installed to bypass ads. The truth is, we hate bad ads too. 

As a solution to this challenge, Museas has developed a strategy that aims to undue this negative perception. Our approach is to collaborate with sponsors to create advertisements that users will enjoy, without feeling tracked or targeted. 


</div>
		<div>In addition to advertisements, sponsors can promote and sell their admission tickets, event tickets, local merchandise, and more right through the Museas Store. On the website or apps, it is is a convenient, fast, and secure place to shop. 

And with full support for Apple Pay®, patrons can pay with TouchID or FaceID for a quicker, easier, and more secure transaction.
